# Azure Pipelines Terraform Extension - Project Instructions

## Overview

This is a fork of the Microsoft DevLabs Azure DevOps extension that provides Terraform integration for Azure Pipelines. It enables running Terraform commands (init, validate, plan, apply, destroy, show, output, workspace, state, fmt, test, get, import, forceunlock, refresh, custom) against cloud providers (Azure, AWS, GCP, OCI) within Azure Pipelines build/release pipelines.

**Fork:** `https://github.com/sethbacon/azure-pipelines-terraform`
Local path: `C:\dev\gh\azure-pipelines-terraform`

**VS Marketplace publisher:** `sethbacon`
**Extension ID:** `pipeline-tasks-terraform`
**Extension name:** `Pipeline Tasks for Terraform`
**Full marketplace address:** `sethbacon.pipeline-tasks-terraform`

## Working Repository

All changes are made in the fork. The GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/unit-test.yml`) is the primary CI target.

## Branch Strategy

- `main` — production-ready; tagged releases only; never force-pushed
- `feature/<description>` — created from `main`; deleted after merge
- `fix/<description>` — bug fix branches from `main`

**Never commit directly to `main`.** Use PRs with conventional-commit titles.

## Commit Convention

Format: `type: short description` (50 chars max for the title)

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `ci`, `deps`, `security`, `perf`

Body line: `Closes #<issue-number>`

Example:

```txt
feat: add registry download strategy to terraform installer

Closes #12
```

## Workflow Per Change

1. Create branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/<description> main`
2. Make changes.
3. Run local quality gate before pushing, from inside the changed task's directory (e.g. `Tasks/TerraformTask/TerraformTaskV5/`) — there is no root-level `compile`/`test` script; each task is an independent npm package:
   - `npm run compile` (TypeScript build, zero errors)
   - `npm test` (all tests pass)
4. Open PR to `main` with a conventional-commit title.
5. CI runs automatically: version consistency check → build + test (Ubuntu + Windows) → type-check tab → actionlint.
6. Squash-merge when CI passes and the PR is approved; the branch is deleted automatically.

## Release Process

Releases are fully automated via [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please):

1. Merge conventional-commit PRs to `main` — release-please accumulates them.
2. release-please opens a **Release PR** that bumps `azure-devops-extension.json` (`version`) and updates `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. The per-task `Minor` bumps happen **automatically** on the Release PR — this used to be a manual step and was repeatedly missed. ADO agents cache tasks by `Major.Minor` and will not pick up new code until `Minor` increments, so every task whose `src/` changed since the last release must have its `task.json` `Minor` incremented before the release is tagged. Three layers enforce this, so in the normal case there is nothing to do by hand:

   - **Auto-bump (primary):** `.github/workflows/release-pr-minor-bumps.yml` triggers on the Release PR (head branch `release-please--…`), runs `scripts/bump-minor-versions.js`, and commits + pushes the bumps back to the PR branch using the release App token — pushing with the App token (not `GITHUB_TOKEN`) is what re-triggers the PR's checks. It is idempotent and self-healing: release-please force-pushes its branch on every new `main` commit, wiping the bump commit, and this workflow re-runs on the resulting `synchronize` and re-applies it (its own push also fires `synchronize`, but that second run is a clean no-op).
   - **Merge gate (backstop):** the `Release PR Minor Bumps` required check in `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml` runs `scripts/check-minor-bumps.js` against the Release PR and fails it if any bump is still missing, so a Release PR can never merge un-bumped (e.g. if the auto-bump workflow was broken).
   - **Tag-time guard (final defense, unchanged):** `release.yml`'s `Verify per-task Minor bumps` step re-runs the same check after the tag is pushed and fails the release if anything slipped through.

   **Security rule (mandatory):** for any release, every task whose code was touched by a **security** issue in at least one of the release's PRs **must** have its `Minor` bumped in that release — never ship a security fix while agents keep serving the cached old code. The automation bumps any task whose `src/` changed, which already covers this; when unsure whether a change qualifies, bump it.

   **Manual fallback (only if the automation is broken):** if the auto-bump workflow is disabled/failing and the merge gate is red, apply the bumps yourself — the simplest way is `node scripts/bump-minor-versions.js` from the repo root, which does exactly what the workflow does. To edit by hand instead, bump `Minor` by 1 (leave `Patch` at 0) in the `task.json` of every task whose `src/` changed since the last release:

   - `Tasks/TerraformTask/TerraformTaskV5/task.json` — if TerraformTaskV5 changed
   - `Tasks/TerraformInstaller/TerraformInstallerV1/task.json` — if TerraformInstallerV1 changed
   - `Tasks/TerraformProviderMirror/TerraformProviderMirrorV1/task.json` — if TerraformProviderMirrorV1 changed
   - `Tasks/PolicyAgentInstaller/PolicyAgentInstallerV1/task.json` — if PolicyAgentInstallerV1 changed
   - `Tasks/TerraformPolicyCheck/TerraformPolicyCheckV1/task.json` — if TerraformPolicyCheckV1 changed
   - `Tasks/TerraformDriftReport/TerraformDriftReportV1/task.json` — if TerraformDriftReportV1 changed
   - `Tasks/TerraformModulePublish/TerraformModulePublishV1/task.json` — if TerraformModulePublishV1 changed
   - `Tasks/TerraformDocsInstaller/TerraformDocsInstallerV1/task.json` — if TerraformDocsInstallerV1 changed
   - `Tasks/TerraformDocs/TerraformDocsV1/task.json` — if TerraformDocsV1 changed
   - `Tasks/Markdown2Html/Markdown2HtmlV1/task.json` — if Markdown2HtmlV1 changed
   - `Tasks/PublishKbArticle/PublishKbArticleV1/task.json` — if PublishKbArticleV1 changed

   **Avoid a double-increment:** when a change must reach agents immediately (e.g. dropping a Node execution handler), `Minor` may have been bumped in the feature PR instead. A task already incremented in a merged feature PR since the last release must **not** be bumped again — both the bump script and the check compare against the last release tag and already skip such tasks, so prefer the script over hand-editing.

4. Merge the Release PR. release-please creates a draft GitHub Release and pushes the `vX.Y.Z` tag.
5. The `release.yml` workflow fires on the tag:
   - Verifies the tag is reachable from `main`
   - Verifies `azure-devops-extension.json` version matches the tag
   - Runs full CI
   - Builds release bundle + packages `.vsix`
   - Generates CycloneDX SBOMs + cosign signature
   - Creates draft GitHub Release with assets
   - **Publishes to VS Marketplace** (requires `marketplace` environment approval)
   - Undrafts the GitHub Release

**Required secrets/variables:**

| Name                       | Type     | Purpose                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AZDO_PUBLISH_CLIENT_ID`   | Variable | Client ID of the Entra app federated to GitHub for the Marketplace publish login |
| `AZDO_PUBLISH_TENANT_ID`   | Variable | Entra tenant ID for the publish login                                            |
| `RELEASE_DISPATCH_APP_ID`  | Variable | GitHub App client ID for release-please                                          |
| `RELEASE_DISPATCH_APP_KEY` | Secret   | GitHub App private key for release-please                                        |

As of PR #218, `release.yml` publishes via **GitHub OIDC federated to Microsoft Entra** — there is no stored `TFX_PAT`. The publish job (under the `marketplace` environment, `id-token: write`) signs in with `azure/login` using the two `AZDO_PUBLISH_*` variables, exchanges the OIDC token for a short-lived Entra access token, and passes it to `tfx extension publish`. The Entra app needs a federated credential with subject `repo:sethbacon/azure-pipelines-terraform:environment:marketplace`.

The `marketplace` environment (Settings → Environments) must have at least one required reviewer so every VS Marketplace publish gets human approval. This is verified automatically by the `verify-marketplace-environment-protection` job in `weekly-security.yml`, which fails the scheduled run (filing an issue) if the required-reviewer rule is missing, removed, or the environment itself no longer exists.

## Publisher Registration

To publish to the VS Marketplace:

1. Navigate to: `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/createpublisher`
2. Sign in with a Microsoft account
3. Publisher ID: `sethbacon`
4. Accept the Marketplace Publisher Agreement
5. Automated publishing uses the GitHub OIDC → Entra federated credential (no PAT). A Marketplace PAT is only needed for manual CLI publishing of private dev builds (see `docs/setup/private-testing.md`).

## Extension Naming — HashiCorp Trademark

HashiCorp's trademark policy prohibits using "Terraform" as a standalone product name. Nominative fair use (accurately describing compatibility) is permitted. The name `"Pipeline Tasks for Terraform"` is compliant — it describes the extension's function without implying official HashiCorp affiliation.

**Always work in TerraformTaskV5.** TerraformInstallerV1 is the active installer task. TerraformProviderMirrorV1 is the provider mirror configuration task. Legacy task versions (V1-V4, InstallerV0) have been removed.

## Task Architecture (TerraformTaskV5)

### Source files: `Tasks/TerraformTask/TerraformTaskV5/src/`

| File                                 | Role                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.ts`                           | Entry point - reads `provider` and `command` inputs, delegates to `ParentCommandHandler`       |
| `parent-handler.ts`                  | Routes provider/backend name to the correct handler class                                      |
| `base-terraform-command-handler.ts`  | Abstract base with shared command implementations                                              |
| `terraform.ts`                       | `TerraformToolHandler` - locates terraform binary and builds `ToolRunner`                      |
| `terraform-commands.ts`              | Data classes: `TerraformBaseCommandInitializer`, `TerraformAuthorizationCommandInitializer`    |
| `azure-terraform-command-handler.ts` | AzureRM-specific backend and provider auth (MSI, WorkloadIdentityFederation, ServicePrincipal) |
| `aws-terraform-command-handler.ts`   | AWS-specific backend and provider auth                                                         |
| `gcp-terraform-command-handler.ts`   | GCP-specific backend and provider auth                                                         |
| `oci-terraform-command-handler.ts`   | OCI-specific backend (HTTP backend via PAR URL) and provider auth                              |
| `environment-variables.ts`           | Helper for setting environment variables with tracking and cleanup                             |
| `secure-file-loader.ts`              | Downloads secure var files from ADO Secure Files library                                       |
| `id-token-generator.ts`              | Generates OIDC ID tokens for Workload Identity Federation fallback                             |

### Structured plan/apply results (`src/results/`)

Builds the redacted JSON digests published to the **Terraform** tab (see `docs/design/plan-apply-digest-spec.md` for the frozen schema/redaction contract):

| File                | Role                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `digest-schema.ts`  | The `PlanDigest`/`ApplyDigest`/`StateDigest` TypeScript shape (schemaVersion 1) — byte-identical copy in `src/tab/`, gated by `scripts/check-shared-modules.js` |
| `caps.ts`           | Size/DoS caps (max resources, max attribute changes, byte ceilings, etc.) — byte-identical copy in `src/tab/`, same gate |
| `redact.ts`         | The recursive redaction core: converts a raw value + its `*_sensitive`/`*_unknown` mask maps into a `RedactedValue`, fail-closed on mask/value shape mismatch |
| `plan-digest.ts`    | Builds a `PlanDigest` from a parsed `terraform show -json <planfile>` object; also accepts an optional `mode: 'destroy'` (Phase 5) so a destroy plan is tagged `planMode: "destroy"` for the tab to label — same builder, same shape, no new type |
| `apply-digest.ts`   | Builds an `ApplyDigest` from the `terraform apply -json` NDJSON event stream                               |
| `state-digest.ts`   | (Phase 5) Builds a `StateDigest` from a parsed `terraform show -json` of the **current state** — a point-in-time resource/data-source/output inventory (no change actions, no before/after, no unknown), redacted against each resource's own `sensitive_values` via the same `redact.ts` core |
| `secret-scrub.ts`   | Freeform-text scrub for apply diagnostics (known-secret string replacement + entropy/format heuristic) and attachment-name sanitization |

`redact.ts` and `state-digest.ts` have only one copy each (task-side); neither is duplicated into `src/tab/` — the task produces a digest, the tab only ever consumes an already-redacted one — so they are intentionally not in the `check-shared-modules.js` parity families. `digest-schema.ts`/`caps.ts` remain the byte-identical parity families; the Phase 5 `StateDigest` type and `MAX_STATE_RESOURCES`/`MAX_STATE_ATTRS_PER_RESOURCE` caps were added to those two existing files (no new family needed).

### Provider dispatch pattern

`ParentCommandHandler.execute(provider, command)` selects the handler via switch/case, then calls `handler[command]()` dynamically. For `init`, the `backendType` input selects the handler (backend/provider are decoupled). For all other commands, the `provider` input selects the handler.

To add a new command: implement it as a method on `BaseTerraformCommandHandler`.
To add a new provider: create a handler class implementing `handleBackend()` and `handleProvider()`, add a case in `parent-handler.ts`.

### Command implementations in `BaseTerraformCommandHandler`

- **`init`** - calls `handleBackend()` then runs `terraform init -backend-config=...`
- **`validate`** - runs `terraform validate` (no auth needed)
- **`plan`** - calls `handleProvider()`, runs with `-detailed-exitcode`, sets `changesPresent` output variable. When `publishPlanResults` is set, captures stdout and publishes as `terraform-plan-results` pipeline attachment (raw fallback view). When `publishPlanSummary` is set, adds `-out=<tempfile>`, runs `terraform show -json` on it, builds a redacted `PlanDigest` (`src/results/plan-digest.ts`), and publishes it as `terraform-plan-summary` for the Terraform tab's Plan pivot. The two are independent and can both be enabled.
- **`apply`** - calls `handleProvider()`, forces `-auto-approve` if not already present. When `publishApplyResults` is set, runs apply with `-json`, echoes each event's `@message` to the console (preserving the live log), builds a redacted `ApplyDigest` (`src/results/apply-digest.ts`, honoring `includeDiagnosticDetail`), and publishes it as `terraform-apply-summary` for the Apply pivot; exit-code/failure semantics are unchanged.
- **`destroy`** - calls `handleProvider()`, forces `-auto-approve` if not already present. When `publishPlanSummary` is set (Phase 5), adds `-out=<tempfile>` to the destroy, runs `terraform show -json` on it, and publishes the resulting `PlanDigest` (via `plan-digest.ts`'s `mode: 'destroy'`) as `terraform-plan-summary`, labeled "Destroy" by the tab — reuses the plan digest unchanged since a destroy plan is a plan whose changes are all deletes. Auto-approve and non-zero-exit failure semantics are unchanged.
- **`show`** - calls `handleProvider()`, supports `outputTo=console|file` and `outputFormat=json|default`. When `publishStateResults` is set (Phase 5) and this show has no positional plan-file argument in `commandOptions` (i.e. it is showing the CURRENT state, not a saved plan file — see `hasPositionalCommandArg()`), runs its own separate `terraform show -json` of the current state, builds a redacted `StateDigest` (`src/results/state-digest.ts`), and publishes it as `terraform-state-summary` for the tab's State pivot.
- **`output`** - calls `handleProvider()`, always uses `-json`, writes to file, sets `jsonOutputVariablesPath`
- **`custom`** - calls `handleProvider()`, runs arbitrary command from `customCommand` input
- **`workspace`** - runs `terraform workspace` with `workspaceSubCommand` (select, new, list, show, delete)
- **`state`** - runs `terraform state` with `stateSubCommand` (list, show, mv, rm, pull, push)
- **`fmt`** - runs `terraform fmt -check` for formatting validation
- **`test`** - runs `terraform test` with optional filter and verbose flags. Service connection is **optional**: omit for unit tests, provide for integration tests that need provider auth
- **`get`** - runs `terraform get` to download modules
- **`import`** - runs `terraform import` with `importAddress` and `importId` inputs
- **`forceUnlock`** - runs `terraform force-unlock` with `lockId` input
- **`refresh`** - calls `handleProvider()`, supports `varFile`, `targetResources`, `parallelism`, `secureVarsFile`, `terraformVariables`

### Azure auth schemes (AzureRM handler)

Three modes via service connection `authorizationScheme`:

1. `WorkloadIdentityFederation` (preferred) - OIDC token; sets `ARM_CLIENT_ID`, `ARM_USE_OIDC`, and either `ARM_OIDC_TOKEN` (id token generation) or, for token refresh, both `ARM_ADO_PIPELINE_SERVICE_CONNECTION_ID` (azurerm's primary variable) and `ARM_OIDC_AZURE_SERVICE_CONNECTION_ID` (AzAPI-compatibility fallback)
2. `ManagedServiceIdentity` - sets `ARM_USE_MSI=true`
3. `ServicePrincipal` - sets `ARM_CLIENT_ID` + `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET` (deprecated)

## TerraformInstaller Task (TerraformInstallerV1)

Source: `Tasks/TerraformInstaller/TerraformInstallerV1/src/terraform-installer.ts`

- Downloads Terraform from `https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/` for the requested version
- Supports `latest` (queries HashiCorp checkpoint API; fails closed with an actionable error — pin an explicit `version` instead — rather than falling back to a stale version if the checkpoint API is unreachable)
- Supports Windows, macOS, Linux on amd64, arm64, arm, 386
- Verifies GPG signature of SHA256SUMS using HashiCorp's embedded public key (`gpg-verifier.ts`)
- Sets `terraformLocation` pipeline variable after install
- Handles proxy configuration via `tasks.getHttpProxyConfiguration()`

## TerraformProviderMirror Task (TerraformProviderMirrorV1)

Source: `Tasks/TerraformProviderMirror/TerraformProviderMirrorV1/src/`

- Generates a `.terraformrc` CLI configuration file with a `provider_installation` block for network mirroring
- Sets `TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` pipeline variable so subsequent `terraform init` routes provider downloads through the mirror
- Supports include/exclude patterns for routing specific providers to the mirror vs direct registry
- Pure config generation — no network calls, no credentials needed
- Intended to run once per agent job, before `terraform init`

| File                  | Role                                                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.ts`            | Entry point — reads inputs, validates URL, writes config   |
| `config-generator.ts` | Pure function generating HCL `provider_installation` block |

## TerraformDocsInstaller Task (TerraformDocsInstallerV1)

Source: `Tasks/TerraformDocsInstaller/TerraformDocsInstallerV1/src/`. Installs **terraform-docs** from `official` (GitHub releases `terraform-docs/terraform-docs`), `registry` (terraform-registry-backend), or `mirror` sources. terraform-docs ships as a `.tar.gz` (Unix) / `.zip` (Windows) archive with a single `terraform-docs-v{version}.sha256sum` file and **no** detached GPG/cosign signature, so — like OPA — it is sha256-verified against the same GitHub release origin (HTTPS + GitHub's release infrastructure is the trust root). Reuses the HTTPS-pinned `http-client.ts` from TerraformInstallerV1 (byte-identical, enforced by `scripts/check-shared-modules.js`); it does not use `gpg-verifier.ts`/`hashicorp-gpg-key.ts`. `latest` resolves via the GitHub releases API. Output variables: `terraformDocsLocation`, `terraformDocsDownloadedFrom`.

## TerraformDocs Task (TerraformDocsV1)

Source: `Tasks/TerraformDocs/TerraformDocsV1/src/`. Runs terraform-docs to generate module documentation. `args-builder.ts` is a pure function mapping the `formatter` picklist (markdown table/document, json, yaml, toml, pretty, asciidoc table/document, tfvars hcl/json) plus the `outputFile`/`outputMode`/`configFile`/`sortBy`/`recursive`/`outputCheck` inputs to an ordered terraform-docs argument list; `index.ts` locates the binary via `tasks.which`, runs it with `ignoreReturnCode`, and fails on a non-zero exit (so `--output-check` can gate a pipeline on stale docs). No cloud auth. Output variable: `generatedFilePath`.

## PolicyAgentInstaller Task (PolicyAgentInstallerV1)

Source: `Tasks/PolicyAgentInstaller/PolicyAgentInstallerV1/src/`. Installs a policy engine — **Sentinel** (GPG-signed zip from releases.hashicorp.com) or **OPA** (raw, sha256-verified binary from GitHub releases `open-policy-agent/opa`) — from `official`, `registry` (terraform-registry-backend), or `mirror` sources. Reuses `gpg-verifier.ts`/`hashicorp-gpg-key.ts`/`http-client.ts` from TerraformInstallerV1. `latest` resolves via the checkpoint API (Sentinel) or the GitHub releases API (OPA). Output variables: `policyAgentLocation`, `policyAgentDownloadedFrom`. OPA only ships amd64/arm64.

## TerraformPolicyCheck Task (TerraformPolicyCheckV1)

Source: `Tasks/TerraformPolicyCheck/TerraformPolicyCheckV1/src/`. Evaluates policies against Terraform plan JSON (`terraform show -json` output). Engine dispatch in `index.ts`:

| File                 | Role                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.ts`           | Orchestrator — resolves source, runs engine, sets outputs, publishes JUnit, cleans up temp dirs                                                                   |
| `opa-engine.ts`      | `opa exec --decision <path> --bundle <dir> <input>`; parses JSON result, gates on `failMode` (nonEmpty/defined)                                                   |
| `sentinel-engine.ts` | Generates `sentinel.hcl` (static import + policies), runs `sentinel apply`, maps exit code (0/1/2/3/9), applies enforcement level (advisory/soft/hard + override) |
| `policy-source.ts`   | `path` (local dir) or `gitUrl` (HTTPS shallow clone / SHA checkout, token delivered as an `http.extraheader` Authorization header via per-invocation `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0`/`GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0` env vars, not argv, so it never appears in the child process's command line) |
| `results.ts`         | Raw output file + JUnit XML + `results.publish` logging command                                                                                                   |

The standalone Sentinel CLI does NOT gate on `enforcement_level` (HCP-only) — the task applies it off the exit code. Policies see the raw `terraform show -json` schema (not the TFC `tfplan/v2` mock). Output variables: `policyResult`, `violationCount`, `resultsFilePath`.

## TerraformDriftReport Task (TerraformDriftReportV1)

Source: `Tasks/TerraformDriftReport/TerraformDriftReportV1/src/`. Parses a Terraform/OpenTofu plan JSON (`terraform show -json` output) into drift counts (create/update/delete) and a changed-resource summary, and optionally POSTs it to a Terraform State Manager (TSM) drift callback URL.

| File              | Role                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.ts`        | Entry point — computes drift counts, orchestrates the callback and SARIF report                                                    |
| `callback.ts`     | POSTs the drift summary to TSM; retries transport failures/5xx only, never after a received response (`callbackToken` is one-shot) |
| `sarif.ts`        | Generates a SARIF 2.1.0 report of drift findings (opt-in)                                                                          |
| `https-client.ts` | Shared HTTPS client, HTTPS-only (shared with TerraformModulePublish)                                                               |

Output variables: `driftDetected`, `addedCount`/`changedCount`/`destroyedCount`, `summaryFilePath` (opt-in `cleanupSummaryFile` removes it after use), `sarifFilePath`.

## TerraformModulePublish Task (TerraformModulePublishV1)

Source: `Tasks/TerraformModulePublish/TerraformModulePublishV1/src/`. Publishes a Terraform module version to HCP Terraform (private module registry) or a private/self-hosted Terraform registry.

| File                   | Role                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.ts`             | Entry point — reads inputs, dispatches to the chosen `registryType`                                     |
| `hcp-publisher.ts`     | Publishes via the HCP Terraform module registry API; polls ingest status                                |
| `private-publisher.ts` | Publishes to a private registry via its API (`apiKey` auth); auto-creates the module if absent          |
| `http.ts`              | Shared HTTP client with bounded retry (`retryHttp()` — the reference implementation other tasks mirror) |
| `https-client.ts`      | Shared HTTPS client, HTTPS-only (shared with TerraformDriftReport)                                      |
| `types.ts`             | Shared type definitions for both publishers                                                             |

## Markdown2Html Task (Markdown2HtmlV1)

Source: `Tasks/Markdown2Html/Markdown2HtmlV1/src/`. Converts Markdown files to HTML for publishing as ServiceNow knowledge base articles — parses YAML front matter, renders via `markdown-it` with `highlight.js` syntax highlighting, and resolves `{% include %}`-style file includes.

| File                  | Role                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.ts`            | Entry point — orchestrates the conversion pipeline                                          |
| `converter.ts`        | Markdown → HTML conversion pipeline                                                         |
| `frontmatter.ts`      | YAML front-matter parsing (`js-yaml`)                                                       |
| `includes.ts`         | Resolves `{% include %}`-style file includes                                                |
| `highlight-theme.ts`  | Syntax-highlighting theme wiring for `highlight.js`                                         |
| `document.ts`         | Document model / metadata                                                                   |
| `render.ts`           | HTML rendering + sanitization (uses `uri-scheme-guard.ts`)                                  |
| `uri-scheme-guard.ts` | Shared XSS-prevention URI/scheme allowlist — byte-identical copy also in PublishKbArticleV1 |

Output variable: `htmlFilePath`.

## PublishKbArticle Task (PublishKbArticleV1)

Source: `Tasks/PublishKbArticle/PublishKbArticleV1/src/`. Publishes or updates a knowledge base article in ServiceNow — create, update, workflow-state transition, and image-attachment sync (content-hash-based idempotency).

| File                   | Role                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.ts`             | Entry point — orchestrates the create/update/workflow flow                                                                 |
| `auth.ts`              | OAuth client-credentials and Basic auth; masks secrets including derived/encoded forms                                     |
| `servicenow-client.ts` | ServiceNow Table API client — every `sysparm_query` interpolation goes through `assertQueryValueSafe()`                    |
| `servicenow-http.ts`   | Shared HTTP client with bounded retry (transport + 5xx only, never a received 4xx)                                         |
| `attachments.ts`       | Image-attachment upload/list/sync                                                                                          |
| `image-rewrite.ts`     | Rewrites local `<img src>` references to uploaded attachment URLs                                                          |
| `html-validate.ts`     | Security gate for article HTML before publish; `force` only bypasses the content-loss heuristic, never the security checks |

Output variables: `kbArticleId`, `kbArticleNumber`, `kbWorkflowState`.

## task.json Schema Key Points

- `id` is the fork's own TerraformTask GUID (`981E87CD-B686-4A9E-B09E-B4AFDEDF126B`), deliberately distinct from the upstream MS DevLabs `FE504ACC-6115-40CB-89FF-191386B5E7BF` — that distinct GUID is what enables the documented side-by-side install. (The legacy `custom-terraform-release-task` contribution id in `azure-devops-extension.json` is a cosmetic carryover that points at the same TerraformTaskV5 folder.)
- `execution` targets `Node24` with a `Node20_1` fallback across all tasks — Node 24 is preferred, and the `Node20_1` handler (re-added 2026-07-05, #380) lets older on-prem/air-gapped agents that lack the Node 24 runner degrade gracefully instead of failing to find a handler. A task's `Minor` must be bumped for agents to re-fetch a handler change
- Inputs use `visibleRule` to conditionally show provider- and command-specific fields
- `dataSourceBindings` wire up picklist inputs to Azure REST API endpoints
- Output variables: `jsonPlanFilePath`, `jsonOutputVariablesPath`, `changesPresent`, `showFilePath`, `customFilePath`

## Development Workflow

### First-time setup

```bash
# For testing TerraformTaskV5
cd Tasks/TerraformTask/TerraformTaskV5
npm install --include=dev
npm test

# For testing TerraformInstallerV1
cd Tasks/TerraformInstaller/TerraformInstallerV1
npm install --include=dev
npm run compile

# For full build + packaging (from repo root)
npm install --include=dev   # installs tfx-cli, webpack, glob-exec, etc.
npm run build:release       # compiles all tasks and bundles with webpack
npm run package:release     # produces .vsix for sethbacon publisher
```

### Test

```bash
cd Tasks/TerraformTask/TerraformTaskV5
npm test
# Runs: tsc -b tsconfig.json && tsc -p tsconfig.tests.json && mocha --timeout 10000 --require ts-node/register Tests/L0.ts
```

### Test structure

Tests are in `Tasks/TerraformTask/TerraformTaskV5/Tests/` and follow a mock-runner pattern. Test files come in pairs:

- `<Name>.ts` - test data/mock setup (mock runner)
- `<Name>L0.ts` - the actual mocha test using `MockTestRunner`

Tests are organized by command x provider: `InitTests/`, `PlanTests/`, `ApplyTests/`, `DestroyTests/`, `MultipleProviderTests/`, `ValidateTests/`, `WorkspaceTests/`, `StateTests/`, `FmtTests/`, `GetTests/`, `TestCommandTests/`, `ShowTests/`, `OutputTests/`, `CustomTests/`, `ImportTests/`, `ForceUnlockTests/`, `RefreshTests/`. `Tests/results/` holds pure-logic tests for the `src/results/` digest builders/redaction (`RedactL0.ts`, `PlanDigestL0.ts`, `ApplyDigestL0.ts`, `StateDigestL0.ts` (Phase 5), `SecretScrubL0.ts`, `GoldenFixturesL0.ts`, `Phase5GoldenFixturesL0.ts`); `Tests/fixtures/` holds the scrubbed golden `show -json`/`apply -json` corpus and its `.expected.json` digests, including the Phase 5 `state-*.json`/`plan-destroy-marked.expected.json` fixtures.

### Personal dev publishing

1. Create `configs/self.json` with your publisher (see CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. `npm run build:release` from repo root
3. `npm run package:self` — generates a `.vsix` file
4. Upload to marketplace as a private extension

## CI/CD

- `.github/workflows/unit-test.yml` — **Active CI.** Runs on push/PR to `main` and on `workflow_call` (reused by release). Jobs: `Check Version Consistency`, `Check Shared Module Parity`, `Build and Test V5`, `Build and Test Installer V1`, `Build and Test Provider Mirror V1`, `Build and Test Module Publish V1`, `Build and Test Policy Agent Installer V1`, `Build and Test Policy Check V1`, `Build and Test Drift Report V1`, `Build and Test terraform-docs Installer V1`, `Build and Test terraform-docs V1`, `Build and Test Markdown2Html V1`, `Build and Test Publish KB Article V1`, `Build and Test Tab`, `Lint GitHub Actions`.
- `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` — **Release automation.** Runs on push to `main`; uses a GitHub App token to open/update the Release PR (version bump + changelog).
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — **Release pipeline.** Triggered by semver tags (`v*.*.*`) or manual dispatch. Verifies tag is on `main`, runs full CI via `workflow_call`, builds release bundle, packages `.vsix`, generates CycloneDX SBOMs, signs with cosign (keyless), creates draft GitHub Release, publishes to VS Marketplace (requires `marketplace` environment approval), then undrafts the release.
- `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` — **Code scanning.** CodeQL static analysis for TypeScript (GitHub Advanced Security).

## Local Development Environment

Verified tooling (as of May 2026):

| Tool               | Status                 | Version                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Node.js            | Installed              | v24.14.0 (Active LTS — matches CI target)        |
| npm                | Installed              | v11.9.0                                          |
| TypeScript (`tsc`) | Not globally installed | Available as dev dep after `npm install`         |
| `tfx-cli`          | Not globally installed | Available as dev dep after `npm install` at root |
| GitHub CLI (`gh`)  | Installed              | v2.87.3                                          |
| Terraform          | Installed              | v1.14.6 at `/c/dev/terraform`                    |

CI and local development both target Node 24 LTS (Active LTS, EOL April 2028). Node 20 is EOL as of April 2026.

## Supported Providers

| Provider  | Handler class                    | Auth method                                                                                   |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `azurerm` | `TerraformCommandHandlerAzureRM` | Workload Identity Federation / MSI / Service Principal                                        |
| `aws`     | `TerraformCommandHandlerAWS`     | AWS service connection credentials                                                            |
| `gcp`     | `TerraformCommandHandlerGCP`     | GCP service connection credentials                                                            |
| `oci`     | `TerraformCommandHandlerOCI`     | OCI private key + TF_VAR_ env vars, or Workload Identity Federation; HTTP backend via PAR URL |

## Important Notes

- The OCI backend does NOT support `-backend-config` CLI flags; it generates a `config-<uuid>.tf` file at runtime
- `plan` uses `-detailed-exitcode`: exit code 2 means changes present (not an error), sets `changesPresent=true`
- `apply` and `destroy` always inject `-auto-approve`
- `warnIfMultipleProviders()` runs `terraform providers` and warns if multiple cloud providers are detected (non-fatal)
- Credential env vars are cleared via `EnvironmentVariableHelper.clearTrackedVariables()` in the `finally` block after every command
- Installer verifies GPG signature of SHA256SUMS before trusting checksums for HashiCorp downloads
- Client secret (ServicePrincipal) auth is deprecated in V5 and will be removed in a future version
- `taint`/`untaint` are NOT supported (removed in Terraform 1.0); use the `-replace` flag on `plan`/`apply` instead
- The **Terraform tab** (`terraform-plan-tab` contribution, displayed as "Terraform") is a build-results-tab extension contribution with Plan/Apply/State pivots (State added Phase 5; no manifest change was needed — it is a pivot inside the same existing contribution). It reads four attachment types: the legacy `terraform-plan-results` (raw ANSI, compatible with jason-johnson/azure-pipelines-tasks-terraform for migration) plus the structured `terraform-plan-summary`/`terraform-apply-summary`/`terraform-state-summary` (redacted structured JSON digests, schemaVersion 1). A destroy plan is published as an ordinary `terraform-plan-summary` (`PlanDigest.planMode === "destroy"`) and rendered in the Plan pivot with a "Destroy" badge — there is no separate destroy attachment type or pivot. The tab UI is in `src/tab/` and bundled via webpack; it only fetches attachments for the current build (same-run only — no cross-run plan↔apply/state correlation).

- Required status checks (strict — branch must be up-to-date): the complete `unit-test.yml` matrix (27 contexts) — `Check Version Consistency`, `Check Shared Module Parity`, every `Build and Test *` job on both `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-2025` (V5, Installer V1, Provider Mirror V1, Module Publish V1, Policy Agent Installer V1, Policy Check V1, Drift Report V1, terraform-docs Installer V1, terraform-docs V1, Markdown2Html V1, Publish KB Article V1), `Build and Test Tab`, `Lint GitHub Actions`, `Scan Workflows (zizmor)`, and `Release PR Minor Bumps` (the pr-checks.yml merge gate — a fast no-op pass on non-release PRs, and the layer-2 backstop that keeps an un-bumped Release PR from merging if the auto-bump workflow is ever broken). Pinned to the GitHub Actions app (`app_id` 15368). Add both matrix legs of any new task's job here when introducing a task.
- Required pull request reviews: 1 approving review, dismiss stale reviews, require code owner review
- Enforce admins: no (admin/owner can bypass review requirements as sole maintainer)
- Required linear history: yes (squash/rebase only, no merge commits)
- Required conversation resolution: yes
- Force pushes: blocked
- Branch deletion: blocked

### Merge Strategy

- **Squash merge only** — merge commits and rebase merges are disabled
- **Delete branch on merge** — enabled; feature/fix branches are cleaned up automatically
- **Allow update branch** — enabled; PRs can pull in base branch changes via GitHub UI
- **Web commit signoff required** — enabled; all web-based commits require DCO signoff

### Dependency Management

- **Dependabot vulnerability alerts** — enabled
- **Dependabot automated security fixes** — enabled
- **Dependabot version updates** — configured via `.github/dependabot.yml` for:
  - GitHub Actions (weekly)
  - npm: all 11 task directories + root (weekly)

### Code Ownership

- **CODEOWNERS** file at `.github/CODEOWNERS` — `@sethbacon` owns all files; `.github/`, `configs/`, and `azure-devops-extension.json` require explicit owner review

### Security Features (GitHub)

- Code scanning: enabled (CodeQL for TypeScript)
- Secret scanning: enabled
- Secret scanning push protection: enabled
- `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` in CI
- All GitHub Actions pinned to full commit SHAs

### Repository Topics

`terraform`, `azure-devops`, `azure-pipelines`, `infrastructure-as-code`, `azure-devops-extension`, `devops`

### Accepted Risk Register

- **Admin bypass of required review, sole CODEOWNERS reviewer (audit #499):** `Enforce admins: no` lets the sole maintainer (`@sethbacon`) push to `main` or merge without satisfying the required-review/required-status-check rules, and CODEOWNERS names that same single account for every path (including `.github/`), so there is structurally no independent second reviewer even when the rule is respected. **Accepted** for a solo-maintainer project: enabling `enforce_admins` today would deadlock every PR that requires code-owner review, since no other codeowner could ever approve it. Revisit once a second maintainer/codeowner exists — see the second-maintainer item below (audit #518).
- **Sole maintainer bus factor (audit #518):** the entire task/provider surface (11 tasks, GPG/cosign trust roots, WIF for 4 clouds, a ServiceNow integration) is maintained by one person — a real availability risk for timely key rotation, incident response, and CVE triage as the surface keeps growing. Recruiting at least a limited-scope second reviewer (e.g., security-only CODEOWNERS rights) remains an **open recommendation**, tracked below under "Remaining Recommendations"; not yet actioned.

### Remaining Recommendations (not yet applied)

- **Enable secret scanning non-provider patterns and validity checks** for broader secret detection
- **Add a second collaborator/maintainer** to reduce bus factor (currently sole maintainer: @sethbacon)
- **Consider adding a tag protection rule** to prevent deletion of release tags (`v*.*.*`)

## Completed Initiatives

All six roadmap initiatives are complete and shipped:

- Initiative 1: Flexible Terraform Installer
- Initiative 2: Complete CLI Coverage
- Initiative 3: Workload Identity Federation for Non-AzureRM
- Initiative 4: Workload Identity Federation for OCI
- Initiative 5: Policy Evaluation (OPA / Sentinel)
- Initiative 6: Drift Report Task

Most detailed planning documents were removed once their initiative shipped; see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the release history. `docs/initiatives/structured-plan-apply-tabs.md` is retained for reference (it is the authoritative design source cited by `docs/design/plan-apply-digest-spec.md`, which normatively fixes only the frozen digest schema/caps and points back to the initiatives doc for the fuller design/redaction-algorithm narrative) — it is not dead/stale despite the shipped feature.
